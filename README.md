# Cosmere Chatbot
This chatbot serves as a lore companion for those interested in the Cosmere. The chatbot, Brando, can help lead you to information about subjects you might want more information on.

There are two main python files in the project, but you only really need to run brandoBot.py. KBEdittor.py is for building the knowledge bases, so it is not needed for the chatbot to work, but I thought I would include it to show my work. 

You will need the NLTK and Scikit-learn libraries to run the chatbot.

To run the chatbot simply call brandoBot.py from the console with no arguments. 

Answer his prompts in a way that makes logical sense, and try not to deviate from that for optimal results.

To exit, after prompted for a topic or specific subject, respond by saying that you would like to exit or stop, and the program should terminate.
